Babel plugin to transform "$" into $ when used as parameters inside your child views and controllers. It's just a minor hack allowing to forward an Alloy controller in cases where this is not possible (ie. ItemTemplate controller)


## Install [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/babel-plugin-titanium-controller-args.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/babel-plugin-titanium-controller-args)

```bash
$ npm install --save inzdr/babel-plugin-titanium-controller-forwarder
```
